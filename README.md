## The first picture

Do you recognize who this beautiful lady is?
Yes,it's Adele.
If you didn't see the funny poit of the picture,let's the same picture upsidedown

We can see the lady's eyes and mouth are actually upside down,but only when we turn the picture around can notice that.
### Explanation
When we see a face upsidedown our ability to recognize the organs is not so good.
Even if I put two pictures together,still you can't tell which picture is the original one.

## The effect of Upsidedown
In 1969,Robert found that if we set things upsidedown,our ability to analyse them decline.
And espeially faces,this is called "the effect of upsidedown face"

Just like the first group of pictures,wo can easily tell that it's Adele in the picture,but we didn't notice her eyes and mouth are totally upsidedown.This means when we met a picture,we have the ability to analyse the whole picture quickly first,but we are not so good at analyse every part or details of the picture.
